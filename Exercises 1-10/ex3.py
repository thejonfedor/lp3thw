print("What is 5 - 7?", float(5 - 7))

print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print("How about some more.")

# Drill/Lesson notes
# 1. Looked up float() and used this since we're using Python3.6
#    looks like this would not have worked if still using python 2
# 2. I didn't write a program for something I need to calculate. Will do this.
