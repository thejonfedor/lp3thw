print() = Print function. Prints out string for user to see
        The print function contains a few parameters including 'end' which
        defines a specific way to end a print function call instead of the
        default parameter which is \n (new line feed).
""      = Double quotation marks define a string
''      = Single quotation marks define a string as well. Synonymous with "".
#       = Octothorpe or hash or pount. these are comments. text in a scrip that
        will not be executed as code.
float() = Float function. will convert contents passed it to float numbers
          float numbers are larger than integers - usually they have decimals.
+       = Plus sign. Adds two numbers together. Also, appends or concatenantes
        two strings together when plus is used between them:
        string1 + string2 = string1string2
-       = Minus sign. Subtracts two numbers from each other.
*       = Asterisk. Multiplies two values to create a product.
/       = Forward slash. Divides two numbers.
%       = Modulus. Performs division of two numbers and RETURNS the REMAINDER.
"var =" = A variable. A variable holds information given to it. Sometimes it
        holds an integer number, sometimes a float number, possibly a file,
        or a string etc.
        Variables make programs dynamic.
        Variables can be printed out and displayed to users in the print() in
        a couple different ways: using curly brackets{} or commas and the var
        name.
round() = The round function rounds the number passed to it to an integer. It
        will also round the input to a certain decimal place if desired.
{}      = Curly brackets. These are formatting tools used to define a holding
        place where python may later pass information to be displayed (see ex 8)
        Also, {} are used to display values held in variables printed out in
        strings by the print().
print f = Print f is a formatted print statement. Print f allows us to add in
        vars to the string with curly brackets and extend the print() in other
        ways.
'''     = Block quotation or documentation block. Triple-double quotation marks
'''     OR triple-single-quotation marks define blocks of text that will NOT
or      be run as code in the script. Rather, they're just visible to the
"""     script readers and usually contain instructions or notes related to
"""     the function and / features of the script.
True/False  = Boolean values. Many (MANY) functions return boolean values of
            yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0. True and false are important
            outputs from functions especially when testing values or answering
            questions of data etc.
str.format()= String format is a string formatting method in python that allows
            for multiple substitutions or value formatting of strings. Can be
            used to pass values to {} inside of strings and values in print().
multiplying strings = It's possible to multiply strings. If you multiply a
                    string in a print(), the string will be printed out the
                    number of times you specify with the second product.

\n      = Backslash n. This is a 'new line' escape character. When used in a
        string, it moves the cursor, or file handler, to the next line down to
        continue printing the remainer of the string or just create a new line.
"""     = It's possible to print blocks of text in a print() using the
"""     documentation block notation (triple or double quotation marks). See
        ex9 for an example.
\t      = Backslash t. Another escape character. This one inserts a tab in the
        output (usually a string).
\\      = Backslash backslash. Escape character in a string to ensure that a
        typed backslash is actually printed. A single backslash would be
        ignored.
